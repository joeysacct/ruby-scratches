Additionally, for inquiry into the nature of this containment procedure, contact the case agent for further details, as available. This interdiction is eternal unless countermanded by direct writ of the Office of IAR. Furthermore, no other body shall have full authority to amend, annul, alter, or sever the order heretofore stated. So signed, ordered, and sealed:
